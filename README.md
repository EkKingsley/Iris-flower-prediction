# Iris-flower-prediction
Predict type of iris flower from a flask web interface.

In this mini project, a hyper-tuned knn model is trained with the iris dataset in sklearn.
This dataset has 150 rows of data with 3 different class of iris namely: Setosa, Versicolor and Virginia.
The model is used to predict a new flower in the flask web page.
The model is saved after it is trained and evaluated. 
The flask web form built is a way for users to use the system by entering measurements taken from such iris flower 
and at the hit of the submit button, a prediction will be made of which 3 iris classes it belongs.
